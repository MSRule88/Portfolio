        <h2>About Me</h2>   
        <p>From a young age I have been intruiged with Computers and Electronics, I started programming with a TRS-80 from Radio Shack and loved to tinker with electronics as a child. This grew into a career as an Electronics Technician for the last 25+ years.  I have taught myself just enough programming over the years to complete specific projects I was working on but recently took courses to become a certified programmer in order to make a career change.  I have been sucessful in building my own Home Automation system as well as a few other apllications. Growing up in Florida, I enjoy the beach and fresh seafood.  Lover of all types of music but in recent years I have aquired a taste for Bluegrass and Jam Bands. I consider myself somewhat artistic and even sell some of my creations! Feel free to take a look at the creations by my alter-ego Rodrick at Rodrick Artistic Designs below!</p>
